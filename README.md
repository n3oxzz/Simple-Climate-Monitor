# Climate Monitor

## Scope & Purpose
As part of my ongoing Arduino learning, I built a small project using the DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor along with a photoresistor to measure and display temperature (Â°C), humidity (%), and light intensity (%). The data is shown on a 16x2 Liquid Crystal Display.
